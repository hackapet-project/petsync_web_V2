## Overview

Hackapet is a comprehensive, open-source web platform designed specifically for animal shelter management. Built with modern technologies and professional development practices, it provides a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for shelter operations.

Born from direct collaboration with rescue organizations like **SOS Peludetes**, the platform addresses real operational challenges faced by shelters that typically rely on paper records, spreadsheets, and messaging apps.

**PetSync** is one of the flagship products: a full-stack animal shelter management system designed to streamline operations, improve transparency, and ultimately help save more animals.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Angular 20.1 + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Django 5.1 + REST Framework + PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Production-ready containerization

## Key Features

### Production Ready

- **Animal Management** - Complete digital profiles with medical history, behavior tracking, and rescue documentation
- **Integrated Calendar** - Veterinary appointments, adoption visits, and event scheduling with automatic notifications
- **Social Media Automation** - Automated posting to multiple platforms when animals become available for adoption
- **Adoption Portal** - Public-facing interface for potential adopters to search and connect with animals
- **Financial Transparency** - Automated tracking and reporting of expenses per animal to build donor trust
- **Medical Records** - Store vaccination schedules, treatment plans, photos of medical documents, and health tracking
- **Flexible Notes System** - Open comment areas alongside structured data fields for comprehensive record-keeping

### Developer Experience

- **One-command setup** - `make up` to start development environment
- **Hot reload** - Instant feedback during development with Angular and Django dev servers
- **Automated testing** - Frontend (Karma/Jasmine) + Backend (Django test framework)
- **Docker containerization** - Consistent development and production environments
- **API versioning** - Structured API design for stability and backward compatibility

### Security & Quality

- **Environment-based configuration** - No hardcoded secrets, secure development practices
- **PostgreSQL database** - Production-grade database with automated migrations
- **JWT authentication ready** - Secure token-based authentication with djangorestframework-simplejwt
- **ULID-based IDs** - Unique, sortable identifiers for all entities
- **TypeScript strict mode** - Type safety and code quality enforcement

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) (for local frontend development)
- **Make** - Usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hackapet-project/petsync_web_V2.git
cd petsync_web_V2

# 2. Start the development environment
make up

# 3. Apply database migrations
make migrate
```

### Access Points

Once the environment is running:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:4000 | Angular development server |
| Backend | http://localhost:9001 | Django API server |
| Admin Panel | http://localhost:9001/admin | Django administration |

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Apply database migrations
make migrate

# Create a superuser for admin access
make superuser

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

## Development Setup

### Available Commands

```bash
# Local Development (with port mappings)
make up          # Start development environment with ports 4000, 9001, 5432
make down        # Stop all containers
make build       # Build/rebuild containers

# Production Deployment (Coolify auto-allocates ports)
make up-prod     # Start without port mappings (for Coolify/cloud)
make down-prod   # Stop production containers
make build-prod  # Build for production deployment

# Database
make migrations  # Create and apply migrations
make migrate     # Apply migrations only

# Testing
make test_back   # Run backend tests

# Utilities
make create_app i=app_name  # Create new Django app
```

**Note**: The main `docker-compose.yml` uses `expose` instead of `ports` to allow Coolify to automatically allocate ports and avoid conflicts. For local development, we use `docker-compose.local.yml` which adds port mappings.

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd front

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm start
# or: ng serve

# Run tests
npm test
# or: ng test

# Build for production
npm run build
# or: ng build
```

### Troubleshooting

**Docker not starting?**

```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker --version
docker compose version

# Start Docker Desktop and try again
make up
```

**Environment issues?**

```bash
# Stop containers
make down

# Rebuild and restart
make build
make up
```

**Port conflicts?**

For local development:
- Frontend: http://localhost:4000
- Backend: http://localhost:9001
- Database: localhost:5432

If you see port conflicts locally, stop other services using these ports or modify `docker-compose.local.yml`.

**Coolify Deployment**: No port configuration needed - Coolify automatically allocates ports based on the `expose` directives in `docker-compose.yml`.
